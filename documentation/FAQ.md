# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is the purpose of this project?
This project aims to provide a predictive maintenance solution that not only predicts equipment failures but also explains the predictions using explainable AI techniques.

### What types of equipment is this system designed for?
The system is designed to be adaptable to various types of industrial equipment, particularly those with sensor data that can indicate potential failures.

## Technical

### What machine learning algorithms are used?
The system primarily uses XGBoost for predictive modeling, with SHAP values for explainability. Other algorithms can be integrated as needed.

### How accurate are the predictions?
Model accuracy depends on the quality and quantity of training data. Typical models achieve 85-95% accuracy on test sets, but this varies by use case.

### How often is the model retrained?
The retraining frequency is configurable. A common approach is to retrain:
- Weekly for models in production
- After significant data drift is detected
- When new labeled failure data becomes available

## Troubleshooting

### The frontend isn't connecting to the backend
1. Ensure the backend server is running
2. Check that the API URL in the frontend configuration is correct
3. Verify CORS settings in the backend
4. Check the browser's developer console for errors

### Model predictions seem inaccurate
1. Check the data quality of recent inputs
2. Verify that all required features are being provided
3. Check if the model needs retraining
4. Review the model's confidence scores

## Deployment

### What are the system requirements?
- **Development**: 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, 10GB free disk space
- **Production**: 16GB+ RAM, 8+ CPU cores, 50GB+ free disk space

### How do I scale the system for more users?
1. Add more API server instances behind a load balancer
2. Use a managed database service
3. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
4. Consider using a CDN for static assets
