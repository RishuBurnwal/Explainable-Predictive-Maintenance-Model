# Project Summary

## Overview
The Explainable Predictive Maintenance Model is a comprehensive solution designed to predict equipment failures and provide interpretable insights into the predictions. This system combines machine learning with explainable AI techniques to help maintenance teams make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-time Monitoring
- Continuous equipment monitoring with live data feeds
- Real-time health status visualization
- Alert system for abnormal conditions

### 2. Predictive Analytics
- Machine learning models for failure prediction
- Remaining useful life estimation
- Anomaly detection in equipment behavior

### 3. Explainable AI
- Model interpretability with SHAP values
- Feature importance visualization
- What-if analysis for different scenarios

### 4. Data Visualization
- Interactive dashboards
- Historical trend analysis
- Performance metrics and KPIs

## Technology Stack
